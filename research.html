            <h1>Our Research -- To conquer aging, theory must go first!</h1>
            <p>To study the method of life extension, we must initially identify the cause and biochemical mechanism of aging, and subsequently design the scheme based on this cause and mechanism. Given that the issue of aging is highly complex, if we disregard the causes and mechanisms of aging and merely rely on chance in the laboratory, it is tantamount to shooting at targets blindfolded, with nearly no possibility of success. Hence, it can be stated that money, laboratories, and technicians alone cannot achieve rejuvenation; we must have a theory. Therefore, we focus on theory.</p>
            <p>There are over 300 theories regarding aging, and almost every theory has given rise to an anti-aging method. However, the majority of these theories are incorrect. Consequently, as of now, no method worldwide has succeeded in rejuvenating humans or significantly extending the human lifespan. Our task is to eliminate erroneous theories and methods through logical reasoning, thereby enabling us to avoid detours and reduce unnecessary waste, because, after all, our time and funds are limited and cannot be expended without constraint.</p>
            <p>For advanced problems, theoretical ability holds greater significance than practical ability, as theory can provide the correct answer and guide the research direction and methodology. For instance, although Einstein was unskilled with his hands and even made crooked small benches, he was capable of theorizing that gravity has fluctuations, and scientists were able to find evidence of gravitational waves based on his theory.</p>

                <h3>Aging theory and Causality of aging hallmarks</h3>
                <p>In our exploration of aging theories from a causal perspective, we have observed that many aging-related changes have been observed and touted as drivers of aging.To address the issue of aging, it is imperative to identify its root causes. This is because targeting the results of aging without addressing the root causes may result in limited efficacy, as interventions focused solely on results fail to address the fundamental issues. By targeting the root causes, both the results and the root causes can be addressed, leading to significant extensions in lifespan.</p>
