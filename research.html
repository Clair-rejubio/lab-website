      <h1>Our Research -- To conquer aging, theory must go first!</h1>
      <p>To study the method of life extension, we must initially identify the cause and biochemical mechanism of aging,
        and subsequently design the solutions based on this cause and mechanism. Given that the issue of aging is highly
        complex, if we disregard the causes and mechanisms of aging and merely rely on chance in the laboratory, it is
        tantamount to shooting at targets blindfolded, with nearly no possibility of success. Hence, it can be stated
        that money, laboratories, and technicians alone cannot achieve rejuvenation; we must have a theory. Therefore,
        we focus on theory.</p>
      <p>There are over 300 theories regarding aging, and almost every theory has given rise to an anti-aging method.
        However, the majority of these theories are incorrect. Consequently, as of now, no method worldwide has
        succeeded in rejuvenating humans or significantly extending the human lifespan. Our task is to eliminate
        erroneous theories and methods through logical reasoning, thereby enabling us to avoid detours and reduce
        unnecessary waste, because, after all, our time and funds are limited and cannot be expended without constraint.
      </p>
      <p>For advanced problems, theoretical ability holds greater significance than practical ability, as theory can
        provide the correct answer and guide the research direction and methodology. For instance, although Albert
        Einstein was unskilled with his hands and even made crooked small benches, he was capable of theorizing that
        gravity has fluctuations, and scientists were able to find evidence of gravitational waves based on his theory.

        <h3>Aging theory</h3>
        <p>Given that every organism has a relatively fixed schedule of growth and development, mature, aging, and
          death, the essence of aging is a genetic program rather than some passive or accidental events occurring in
          the cell, such as the accumulation of harmful waste, mitochondrial and DNA mutations and accumulations, etc.
          Moreover, the program at the individual level is regulated by the program at the DNA level.</p>
        <p>Through rigorous logical reasoning and experimental research, we found that the root cause of cellular senescence and Hayflick limits are telomere DNA and rDNA.
          In other word, the aging of tissue, organ, individual is caused by the aging of adult stem cells and the aging of adult stem
          cells is caused by the reduction of telomere DNA and rDNA copy numbers. 
          Consequently, to surpass the limitations of lifespan, it is essential to extend telomeres and rDNA. 
          Moreover, merely reversing epigenetic inheritance or modulating signaling pathways will prove ineffective.</p>

        <div class="project-item">
          <h3>Causality of aging hallmarks </h3>
          <p>Aging causes constitutes the fundamental factor guiding the aging of the body, and the aging phenomenon /
            aging hallmarks / aging results pertains to the various manifestations exhibited by the body after aging.
            There may be only one cause of aging, but there may be thousands of aging phenomena. For instance, the aging
            of facial skin leads to the formation of wrinkles and hair turns white. Lipofuscin is deposited in the inner
            cytoplasm, protein renewal rate decreases, cross-linked denateration protein increases, mitochondrial DNA
            mutation accumulation, protein glycosylation and cross-linking and other aging phenomena are the aging
            results, which is reversible.</p>
          <p>In our exploration of aging theories from a causal perspective, we have observed that many aging-related
            changes have been observed and touted as drivers of aging. To address the issue of aging, it is imperative
            to identify its root causes. This is because targeting the results of aging without addressing the root
            causes may result in limited efficacy, as interventions focused solely on results fail to address the
            fundamental issues. By targeting the root causes, both the results and the root causes can be addressed,
            leading to significant extensions in lifespan.</p>
          <p>For example, in 1973, Tappel found that adult mice fed with a diet containing vitamin E for one year indeed
            had less lipofuscin, but no reduction in mortality (Shikai Xu, Ed., Pharmacology of Anti-Aging, p. 256).
            Conclusion: Lipofuscin deposition is an aging phenomenon, not a cause of aging. There are more than 300
            theories to explain why people age, but the vast majority of them mistakenly treat aging results as cause.
          </p>
          <p>If the aging phenomenon is utilized as a basis for developing solutions aimed at extending life or
            achieving rejuvenation, then this initial approach is fundamentally wrong. It represents a bottomless pit;
            regardless of the time and financial resources invested, the ultimate outcome will be failure.</p>

          <h3>Aging and degenerative diseases</h3>
          <p>Leonard Hayflick once argued that, Richard Adelman published a paper titled "The Study of Aging in Alzheimer's Disease"in 1995, in which he argued that the NIA had disproportionately invested heavily in Alzheimer's research, leaving almost no funding available for research that cared about the basic principles of aging. It's reasonable to research age-related diseases, but it's absurd to ignore the biggest risk factors for them. We need to understand that even if we completely cured or even eliminated all the diseases of aging, humans would still age.</p>
          <p>Most people pay more attention to those age-related diseases because they only see their family or friends suffering from these diseases, but they never realize that the most important part in the name of "age-related disease" is "aging", not "disease".</p>
          <p>Alzheimer's disease, liver cirrhosis, pulmonary fibrosis, cancer, type 2 diabetes, and obesity in the
            elderly are all caused by aging, and there is no medicine that can provide a radical cure. Consequently,
            addressing the root cause of aging is more effective than tackling each disease individually.</p>
